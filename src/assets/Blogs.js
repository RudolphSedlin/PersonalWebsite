        post: 'Not keen on resting on my laurels, I have consulted friends and colleagues for suggestions for improvements that could be made to this page in the very short term, and they are as follows: <br /> <br /> <ul class="left"> <li class="list"> <tab /> Fixed the scaling of multimedia (everything should now fit on mobile displays properly, rather than spilling offscreen). </li> <li class="list"> <tab /> Most elements should now be padded, text should not be crammed right up against the edge of the display anymore. </li> <li class="list"> <tab /> The Contact fields have now been turned into flexboxes, so the phone number should not dissasosciate from its bold header anymore under exotic resolutions. </li> <li class="list"> <tab /> The Qualifications page has been consolidated into the ABout page, and my resume has been removed due to redundancy. </li> <li class="list"> <tab /> Contacts were moved to a new page, as anyone sufficiently interested will invest the extra click. </li> </ul> These not-so-small changes do not significantly alter the page or the tech stack, keeping it fast but making it much more pleasant. <br /> Additionally, HTTPS should also be enabled sometime after this post.',

        post: 'Making a portfolio has given me an excuse to get into blogging on my terms. In truth, I should probably commit more to writing, my imagination is fairly active, but much is lost in assorted day-to-day chaos, and my other online media presence is spartan. Still, this blog will be updated as more developments come in. Commentary on these posts may be on the itenerary, but likely not in the short term, due to other tasks.',
