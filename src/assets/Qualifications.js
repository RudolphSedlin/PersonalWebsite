Hosted my own databases on mutliple machines and connected to them remotely.

In this time I have become very well versed with these systems through extensive troubleshooting and bootstrapping on my part, often for my own curiosity. Currently, I use a Fedora instance to host this website, and Arch for most of my desktop and productivity machines. I have organized the Stevens Linux Users Group to further encourage students to learn and utilize Linux systems more on campus.'],
